Just as spending a month in bed . . . leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors. Much of our modern, structured, world has been harming us with top-down policies and contraptions . . . which do precisely this: an insult to the antifragility of systems. This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most [emphasis added].11

Trigger warnings are counter-therapeutic because they encourage avoidance of reminders of trauma, and avoidance maintains PTSD. Severe emotional reactions triggered by course material are a signal that students need to prioritize their mental health and obtain evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral therapies that will help them overcome PTSD. These therapies involve gradual, systematic exposure to traumatic memories until their capacity to trigger distress diminishes.32 Cognitive behavioral therapists treat trauma patients by exposing them to the things they find upsetting (at first in small ways, such as imagining them or looking at pictures), activating their fear, and helping them habituate (grow accustomed) to the stimuli.

This is a book about wisdom and its opposite. It is a book about three psychological principles and about what happens to young people when parents and educators—acting with the best of intentions—implement policies that are inconsistent with those principles. We can summarize the entire book by contrasting the three opening quotations and the three Great Untruths. PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE WISDOM GREAT UNTRUTH Young people are antifragile. Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias.

Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother. Always trust your feelings. We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism. The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.

Benjamin Franklin wrote this to Samuel Johnson: Nothing is of more importance to the public weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of Ignorance and Wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people.

This approach was explained to me by Judson Brewer, who did a study on it at Yale Medical School (and also did one of the main studies showing that meditation quiets the default mode network). Brewer said the basic idea is to not fight the urge to, say, smoke a cigarette. That doesn’t mean you succumb to the urge and light up a cigarette. It just means you don’t try to push the urge out of your mind. Rather, you follow the same mindfulness technique that you’d apply to other bothersome feelings—anxiety, resentment, melancholy, hatred. You just calmly (or as calmly as possible, under the circumstances) examine the feeling. What part of your body is the urge felt in? What is the texture of the urge? Is it sharp? Dull and heavy? The more you do that, the less the urge seems a part of you; you’ve exploited the basic irony of mindfulness meditation: getting close enough to feelings to take a good look at them winds up giving you a kind of critical distance from them. Their grip on you loosens;

There’s an acronym used to describe this technique: RAIN. First you Recognize the feeling. Then you Accept the feeling (rather than try to drive it away). Then you Investigate the feeling and its relationship to your body. Finally, the N stands for Nonidentification, or, equivalently, Nonattachment. Which is a nice note to end on, since not being attached to things was the Buddha’s all-purpose prescription for what ails us

The point here is not as simple as “they failed because they didn’t change.” As we’ll see in the later stages of decline, companies that change constantly but without any consistent rationale will collapse just as surely as those that change not at all. There’s nothing inherently wrong with adhering to specific practices and strategies (indeed, we see tremendous consistency over time in great companies), but only if you comprehend the underlying why behind those practices, and thereby see when to keep them and when to change them.

My point, rather, is that Merck committed itself to attaining such huge growth that Vioxx had to be a blockbuster, which, in turn, positioned the company for a gigantic fall if Vioxx failed to live up to its promise.

Leaders who fail the process of succession set their enterprises on a path to decline. Sometimes they wait too long; sometimes they never address the question at all; sometimes they have bad luck and their chosen successor leaves or dies; sometimes they deliberately set their successor up for failure; and sometimes they just flat out pick badly. But however and whenever it happens, one of the most significant indicators of decline is the reallocation of power into the hands of leaders who fail to comprehend and/or lack the will to do what must be done—and equally, what must not be done—to sustain greatness.

The point is not that Motorola erred in its early development of Iridium or that TI had greater prescience in developing DSP. If you always knew ahead of time which new ideas would work for sure, you would invest in only those. But you don’t. That’s why great companies experiment with a lot of little things that might not pan out in the end. At the start of Iridium and DSP, both Motorola and TI wisely invested in small-scale experimentation and development, but TI, unlike Motorola, bet big only once it had the weight of accumulated empirical evidence on its side. Audacious goals stimulate progress, but big bets without empirical validation, or that fly in the face of mounting evidence, can bring companies down, unless they’re blessed with unusual luck. And luck is not a reliable strategy.

The Challenger story highlights a key lesson. When facing irreversible decisions that have significant, negative consequences if they go awry—what we might call “launch decisions”—the case for launch should require a preponderance of empirical evidence that it’s safe to do so. Had the burden of proof rested on the side of safety (“If we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it’s safe to launch, we delay”) rather than the other way around, Challenger might have been spared its tragedy.

Bill Gore, founder of W. L. Gore & Associates, articulated a helpful concept for decision making and risk taking, what he called the “waterline” principle. Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won’t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor.

MARKERS FOR STAGE 3 • AMPLIFY THE POSITIVE, DISCOUNT THE NEGATIVE: There is a tendency to discount or explain away negative data rather than presume that something is wrong with the company; leaders highlight and amplify external praise and publicity. • BIG BETS AND BOLD GOALS WITHOUT EMPIRICAL VALIDATION: Leaders set audacious goals and/or make big bets that aren’t based on accumulated experience, or worse, that fly in the face of the facts. • INCURRING HUGE DOWNSIDE RISK BASED ON AMBIGUOUS DATA: When faced with ambiguous data and decisions that have a potentially severe or catastrophic downside, leaders take a positive view of the data and run the risk of blowing a hole “below the waterline.” • EROSION OF HEALTHY TEAM DYNAMICS: There is a marked decline in the quality and amount of dialogue and debate; there is a shift toward either consensus or dictatorial management rather than a process of argument and disagreement followed by unified commitment to execute decisions. • EXTERNALIZING BLAME: Rather than accept full responsibility for setbacks and failures, leaders point to external factors or other people to affix blame. • OBSESSIVE REORGANIZATIONS: Rather than confront the brutal realities, the enterprise chronically reorganizes; people are increasingly preoccupied with internal politics rather than external conditions. • IMPERIOUS DETACHMENT: Those in power become more imperious and detached; symbols and perks of executive-class status amplify detachment; plush new office buildings may disconnect executives from daily life.

When people reflect on what it takes to be mentally fit, the first idea that comes to mind is usually intelligence. The smarter you are, the more complex the problems you can solve—and the faster you can solve them. Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn

In psychology there are at least two biases that drive this pattern. One is confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see. These biases don’t just prevent us from applying our intelligence. They can actually contort our intelligence into a weapon against the truth.

Long covid Health care and workplaces must adjust for long covid 1.5% of working-age people have lasting symptoms May 1st 2021 AS THE WORLD enters the second year of the pandemic, two crises are unfolding. The more urgent and visible one is in poor countries like India, where a surge of covid-19 cases is threatening to overwhelm the state. India is recording more than 350,000 cases a day, and many more than that are thought to be going undetected (see Asia section). The suffering is grievous. Oxygen supplies at Indian hospitals are running far short of what is needed, and crematoriums are overwhelmed. The other crisis is more subtle. This is long covid, which is becoming apparent in rich countries like America, Britain and Israel that have largely vaccinated their way out of the pandemic, but which will affect poor ones, too. Post-covid syndrome, to give it its formal name, is a set of symptoms affecting any part of the body that persist for at least three months after a bout of covid-19. Three stand out: breathlessness, fatigue and “brain fog”. In Britain three in every five people with long covid say their usual activities are somewhat limited, and one in five says they are limited “a lot”—which often means being unable to do even a part-time, desk-based job. The numbers are chilling. Half a million people in Britain have had long covid for more than six months. Their chances of full recovery are probably slim. The vast majority are in their working-age prime. At the last count (which does not fully take in the country’s second wave) 1.1% of Britain’s population had had long covid for at least three months—a group that includes 1.5% of those of working age. About 15% of Britain’s population had been infected by then. Applying this rate to global covid-19 cases, numbering an estimated 1.2bn so far, suggests that more than 80m people may already have long covid. The costs of the condition have yet to be tallied, but they will be huge. Britain’s National Institute for Health Research found that, in 80% of sufferers, the illness affected the ability to work. Over a third said it had weighed on their finances. As yet, long covid has no cure. What scientists know so far about the disease points to it being a combination of a persistent viral infection (for which a drug may be found at some point), a chronic autoimmune disorder (which would need expensive, complex care like that for rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis) and lingering damage to some tissues caused by the original covid-19 infection. Medicines for the first two of these causes may ultimately be found. America alone has put $1.15bn into research. At the moment, though, sufferers need months of rehabilitation to help them cope. Health-care systems and employers must prepare to assist long-covid sufferers, including those who have no proof of past infection because they were not able to be tested. Prompt rehabilitative care can prevent a downward spiral in personal health and finances. Dedicated long-covid clinics will speed things up. As things now stand, patients often bounce from one specialist to another in search of a diagnosis. Employers, for their part, must rethink how to accommodate workers with a disability that flares up in unpredictable bouts. Governments can help, with incentives that encourage sufferers to stay in work and employers to cater to their condition. If governments miss the boat, millions of young and mid-career workers could permanently drop out of the labour force. One approach could draw on a scheme for disability benefits that is used in the Netherlands. Dutch employersand employees who are too unwell to work as normal are required to come up jointly with a plan on how the sick employee can return to work under new conditions. Remote working and flexible schedules would make it easier for long-covid sufferers to work at least part-time. Many of them will improve, though even that can take months. Lots of mistakes were made in the pandemic’s acute phase. But that came out of the blue. There is no excuse for failing to respond to long covid. And there is no time to waste. ■ This article was downloaded by emagazine.link from economist.com

First, we don’t know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people’s biases are now believed and spread among millions of people. Second, we create our own echo chambers. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, unfollow, and block everybody else. Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. All of us probably know that. It’s as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars. And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in one hundred forty characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet, and we are less motivated to change these views, even when new evidence arises. Fifth—and in my point of view, this is the most critical—today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. It’s as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.

Louisiana State University business professor, Leon C. Megginson, at the convention of the Southwestern Social Science Association in 1963. Megginson reportedly said: Yes, change is the basic law of nature. But the changes wrought by the passage of time affect individuals and institutions in different ways. According to Darwin’s Origin of Species, it is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself. Applying this theoretical concept to us as individuals, we can state that the civilization that is able to survive is the one that is able to adapt to the changing physical, social, political, moral, and spiritual environment in which it finds itself.

我所謂「重組問題框架」，就是要在走這條路的時候多繞上一圈：刻意暫時偏離原本的方向，讓人暫時將注意力轉移到更高層次的問題，也就是去弄清楚問題原本的框架。這樣一來，等到重新回到原本的方向時，會對問題有全新或更好的理解。你也可以把它想像成在前進途中暫時休息一下，或是在行動前先退後一步。

在先前分享的「重組問題框架表」中，可以看到三個步驟：建立框架、重組問題框架、前進；其中第二步還會再細分為一些策略。在下圖中，我們會看到這幾個步驟如何對應到這個「繞一圈」上。 第1步：建立框架 這個步驟會促發「繞一圈」的動作。實際的做法是，有人得先問：「我們到底是要解決什麼問題？」得到的答案（最好把它寫下來）就是對這個問題的原始框架。 第2步：重組問題框架 「重組問題框架」是要挑戰自己原本對問題的理解，目標是能夠盡快找出最多的不同框架。你可以把它想成是腦力激盪，但目的並非要想出點子，而是找出不同的思考方式；可能是個問題（「『電梯太慢』到底為什麼會對人造成問題？」），也可能是直接提出觀點（「或許是顧客想降低租金的一種談判手段」）。 第2步的五項策略可以讓人找出其他問題框架。可視情況選擇部分、全部、或完全不採用以下這幾項策略： 跳出框架：我們缺了什麼？ 重新思考目標：有沒有更好的目標？ 檢視亮點：有哪些地方沒遇到這種問題？ 照照鏡子：在這個問題的形成中，我╱我們扮演什麼角色？ 以他人觀點思考：他們的問題是什麼？ 第3步：前進 這個步驟會結束「繞一圈」的過程，切換回行動模式。前進時可以延續目前的方向，也可以嘗試一些你想出來的新框架，或是把兩者結合。

麻省理工學院的教授葛瑞格森（Hal Gregersen）也是研究解決問題的學者，他就提出一種稱為「問題大爆發」[6]（question burst）的練習：只給每人2分鐘來解釋自己的問題，接著再用4分鐘進行團體提問。葛瑞格森表示：「大家通常都以為自己的問題需要詳細解釋才說得清楚，但為了要快速告訴別人自己的問題，就只能提出更高層次的問題框架，因此反而不會對後續的提問造成限制或引導。」 許多問題經過短短5分鐘後仍然沒辦法弄清楚如何解決，這時可能需要經過多次「重組問題框架」，並穿插一些實驗性的行動。不過即便如此，最初的重組問題框架依然至關重要，能讓問題有時間沉澱一下，開啟之後靈光乍現的契機[7]。

題寫下來的好處多多。舉例來說： 可以讓你放慢腳步：書寫能夠創造出一個短暫且自然的思考空間，讓人不會太早跳進解決方案模式。 可以逼你把話講得更具體：問題如果只用「想」的，其實會十分模糊，寫成書面就會比較清楚。 可以創造心理距離：如果能讓問題變成一個具體存在的事物、與自己拉開距離，就更容易客觀看待。 可以讓你更容易獲得協助：透過書面的問題陳述，能讓諮詢對象更容易為你提供有效的協助。 可以作為討論的檢查點：每當有人提出想法，你可以將討論迅速導向問題陳述：「這個點子能夠解決這項問題嗎？」（有時某個想法可能讓你考慮更改原本的問題陳述，這也是好事。畢竟問題解決的關鍵並不在於堅守既有框架，而是要找出「對的問題」與「好的解決方案」。） 可以留下書面足跡：為客戶工作時，留下書面的問題陳述將有助於在未來避免衝突。人類的記憶很容易犯錯，要是沒有將問題書面化，客戶有可能會記錯他們要你解決的問題。

要解決問題時，這種目標導向的問題有一項特徵：需要做到機會辨識（opportunity identification）。雖然一般來說，機會辨識屬於創新研究的領域、而不是問題解決的領域，但機會辨識所需要的技巧會和重組問題框架及尋找問題密切相關。舉例來說，許多成功的創新都是因為重新思考「客戶真正在意的是什麼」，而不是去思考市面上現有解決方案想解決的問題

在重組問題框架之前，肯定得先找出問題現有的框架，作為整個流程的起點。做法如下： 詢問「我們現在要解決什麼問題？」用這個問題開始重組問題框架的流程。你也可以問：「我們在解決對的問題嗎？」或是「我們先重新看一下問題。」 如果可行，也可以快速寫出問題陳述，用幾句話把問題描述出來。記得段落勿冗長、並使用完整的句子。 在問題陳述旁邊列出主要的利害關係人：這個問題會與誰利益相關？

a heuristic for answering a difficult question is to find the answer to an easier one. The substitution of one question for the other causes predictable errors, called psychological biases.

Psychological Biases Cause Noise We have briefly presented three types of biases that operate in different ways: substitution biases, which lead to a misweighting of the evidence; conclusion biases, which lead us either to bypass the evidence or to consider it in a distorted way; and excessive coherence, which magnifies the effect of initial impressions and reduces the impact of contradictory information

Speaking of Heuristics, Biases, and Noise “We know we have psychological biases, but we should resist the urge to blame every error on unspecified ‘biases.’” “When we substitute an easier question for the one we should be answering, errors are bound to occur. For instance, we will ignore the base rate when we judge probability by similarity.” “Prejudgments and other conclusion biases lead people to distort evidence in favor of their initial position.” “We form impressions quickly and hold on to them even when contradictory information comes in. This tendency is called excessive coherence.”

Psychological biases cause statistical bias if many people share the same biases. In many cases, however, people differ in their biases. In those cases, psychological biases create system noise

Speaking of the Sources of Noise “We easily see differences in the average level of judgments, but how large is the pattern noise we do not see?” “You say this judgment was caused by biases, but would you say the same thing if the outcome had been different? And can you tell if there was noise?” “We are rightly focused on reducing biases. Let’s also worry about reducing noise

Speaking of Sequencing Information “Wherever there is judgment, there is noise—and that includes reading fingerprints.” “We have more information about this case, but let’s not tell the experts everything we know before they make their judgment, so as not to bias them. In fact, let’s tell them only what they absolutely need to know.” “The second opinion is not independent if the person giving it knows what the first opinion was. And the third one, even less so: there can be a bias cascade.” “To fight noise, they first have to admit that it exists.”

Speaking of Selection and Aggregation “Let’s take the average of four independent judgments—this is guaranteed to reduce noise by half.” “We should strive to be in perpetual beta, like the superforecasters.” “Before we discuss this situation, what is the relevant base rate?” “We have a good team, but how can we ensure more diversity of opinions?”

Speaking of Structure in Hiring “In traditional, informal interviews, we often have an irresistible, intuitive feeling of understanding the candidate and knowing whether the person fits the bill. We must learn to distrust that feeling.” “Traditional interviews are dangerous not only because of biases but also because of noise.” “We must add structure to our interviews and, more broadly, to our selection processes. Let’s start by defining much more clearly and specifically what we are looking for in candidates, and let’s make sure we evaluate the candidates independently on each of these dimensions.” CHAPTER 25 The Mediating Assessments Protocol S ome time ago, two of us (Kahneman and Sibony), together with our friend Dan Lovallo, described a method of decision making in organizations.

Rules or standards? First, ask which produces more mistakes. Then, ask which is easier or more burdensome to produce or work with.” “We often use standards when we should embrace rules—simply because we don’t pay attention to noise.” “Noise reduction shouldn’t be part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—at least not yet. Still, noise can be horribly unfair. All over the world, legal systems should consider taking strong steps to reduce it.”

When we shift out of scientist mode, the rethinking cycle breaks down, giving way to an overconfidence cycle. If we’re preaching, we can’t see gaps in our knowledge: we believe we’ve already found the truth. Pride breeds conviction rather than doubt, which makes us prosecutors: we might be laser-focused on changing other people’s minds, but ours is set in stone. That launches us into confirmation bias and desirability bias. We become politicians, ignoring or dismissing whatever doesn’t win the favor of our constituents—our parents, our bosses, or the high school classmates we’re still trying to impress. We become so busy putting on a show that the truth gets relegated to a backstage seat, and the resulting validation can make us arrogant. We fall victim to the fat-cat syndrome, resting on our laurels instead of pressure-testing our beliefs.
